# rapdata_demo
Demonstration for 2017 AMS student conference: creation of event-centered RAP composites using only command-line tools

The 'get_rap130_1hr.bash' script is all you need to run here.  It does require some additional software on your system, which is listed near the top of that script.  Enjoy!
